## MANDATORY ENTERPRISE METHODOLOGY

### PHASE 0: ENTERPRISE PROJECT MANAGEMENT (REQUIRED)
All agents must use FREE MCP tools for proper foundation:

#### PROJECT SETUP & DOCUMENTATION
- Use `filesystem-project-mgmt` for project structure:
  - /requirements/ - Business requirements and specs
  - /documentation/ - Technical documentation
  - /workflows/ - N8N workflow files
  - /testing/ - Test cases and validation
  - /deployment/ - Production deployment docs

#### RESEARCH & ANALYSIS
- Use `web-research` for:
  - Industry best practices for workflow type
  - Existing solutions and approaches
  - Security considerations and compliance
  - Performance optimization strategies

#### PROJECT PLANNING
- Use `time-management` for:
  - Project timeline and milestones
  - Resource allocation estimates
  - Testing and validation schedule
  - Go-live planning

- Use `calculator-utilities` for:
  - ROI calculations and business impact
  - Performance metrics and SLA requirements
  - Cost-benefit analysis

#### VERSION CONTROL SETUP
- Use `git-version-control` for:
  - Repository initialization
  - Branching strategy (dev/staging/prod)
  - Change management process

### PHASE 1: TECHNICAL DISCOVERY
DEV AGENT must use N8N expert MCP tools:
- `get_database_statistics()` - Confirm MCP connection
- `search_nodes()` - Find all required node types
- `get_node_essentials()` - Get proper configurations for each node
- `list_tasks()` - Check for pre-built patterns
- `get_node_for_task()` - Use common patterns when available

### PHASE 2: TECHNICAL CONFIGURATION
DEV AGENT implementation requirements:
- Build configurations using exact schemas from `get_node_essentials()`
- Use `get_property_dependencies()` for field relationships
- Apply current typeVersions from essentials data
- Include ALL required fields

### PHASE 3: TECHNICAL VALIDATION (CRITICAL)
DEV AGENT must validate EVERYTHING:
- `validate_node_minimal()` on each node for required fields
- `validate_node_operation()` with "strict" profile on each node
- Fix ALL errors and warnings before proceeding
- Re-validate until each node shows `"valid": true`

### PHASE 4: WORKFLOW ASSEMBLY
DEV AGENT workflow creation:
- Create workflow JSON with proper node names (NOT IDs) in connections
- Ensure connections use exact node names from workflow
- Include comprehensive error handling and fallback paths
- Implement monitoring and logging capabilities

### PHASE 5: FINAL VALIDATION & DOCUMENTATION
DEV AGENT final steps:
- `validate_workflow()` on complete workflow
- Must show `"valid": true, "errorCount": 0` before output
- Create comprehensive documentation using `filesystem-project-mgmt`
- Document deployment procedures and rollback plans

### PHASE 6: ENTERPRISE OUTPUT STANDARDS
ALL AGENTS collaboration for delivery:
- Complete, importable workflow JSON
- Detailed setup instructions for credentials
- Security considerations and compliance documentation
- Comprehensive test cases and validation procedures
- Operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides
- Performance monitoring and alerting setup

## QUALITY REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
✅ All nodes must use current typeVersions
✅ All required properties must be included
✅ All connections must use node names (not IDs)
✅ Error handling and recovery must be implemented
✅ Workflow must pass full validation
✅ Must include security and compliance considerations
✅ Must have comprehensive documentation and testing
✅ Must be production-ready with monitoring and alerting
✅ Must follow enterprise change management processes

## NEVER DO THESE THINGS
❌ Output unvalidated workflows
❌ Guess at node configurations
❌ Use outdated typeVersions
❌ Skip validation phases
❌ Use node IDs in connections
❌ Skip enterprise project management phase
❌ Deploy without proper documentation
❌ Ignore security or compliance requirements

- Pass detailed specifications to the next agent in the chain
- Maintain version control using `git-version-control`

### VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS
- ANALYST validates requirements completeness
- PM validates project feasibility and timeline
- ARCHITECT validates technical design and integration points
- SM validates story completeness and testability
- DEV validates technical implementation and functionality
- QA validates production readiness and compliance

### CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

- Update project documentation throughout the process
- Maintain audit trail for compliance and future reference

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
A successful BMad N8N workflow generation must deliver:
1. **100% working workflow** that imports and runs without errors
